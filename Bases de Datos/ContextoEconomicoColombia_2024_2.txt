RELEASE DATE FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2024
Inflation continues to decline, but remains well above 3%. It is projected to reduce significantly in 2024 and converge to the goal in the first half of 2025.

Price growth in the economy continues to moderate, as illustrated by the drop in annual inflation from 11% to 9.3% between September and December 2023.
The reduction in the variation in food prices during 2023 contributed significantly to the fall in inflation. The behavior of commodity prices also favored this dynamic.
The decline in inflation has been limited by the behavior of service prices, because consumption of services remains at high levels and because several of their prices are updated based on the high inflation rates recently recorded (indexation ). The decline in inflation has also been slowed by the necessary increases in fuel prices.
Going forward, inflation is expected to continue reducing and converge to the 3% goal in the first half of 2025.
The absence of strong increases in the exchange rate along with lower external inflation, lower spending pressures on prices due to the slowdown in the economy, and the cumulative effect of policy actions would continue to contribute to the gradual reduction in inflation. monetary policy of the Bank of the Republic.
Some risks remain that could cause inflation to decline more slowly than projected, such as an unexpected increase in the exchange rate or stronger effects of the El Niño phenomenon on food prices and energy.
The decrease in inflation would occur in the context of economic growth that would remain low in 2024 and recover in 2025.

At the end of 2023, economic activity would have continued to slow, reflecting low levels of investment and, to a lesser extent, a moderation in consumption.
The unemployment rate remains at relatively low levels, although it has increased in recent months.
The economy would continue with low growth rates in 2024, which would consolidate the process of convergence of inflation towards the target.
From the second half of 2024, the economy would accelerate and in 2025 it would reach sustainable levels, compatible with its productive capacity.

The monetary policy stance has contributed to the reduction of inflation and other macroeconomic imbalances in the country. Inflation and its expectations have fallen, although they remain above the 3% goal, and the economy has slowed. In this context, the Board of Directors of the Bank of the Republic reduced its monetary policy interest rate from 13.25 to 12.75%.

The monetary policy decisions of the Bank of the Republic have favored the correction of the macroeconomic imbalances accumulated in recent years, such as, for example, high inflation, excess spending and credit, and the large external deficit.
With this, the macroeconomic environment has evolved in the required direction, by:
an adjustment of economic activity towards levels more compatible with the productive capacity of the economy;
a more sustainable balance of foreign transactions; and,
a decrease in inflation and its expectations.

Given these results and in the context of decreasing inflation and low economic growth, the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República reduced the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points at its meetings in December 2023 and January 2024, bringing it at 12.75%.
This interest rate recognizes the decrease in inflation and its expectations, and seeks the convergence of inflation to the 3% goal in mid-2025, as well as the achievement of a path of sustainable economic growth over time.
